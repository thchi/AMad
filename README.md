## Overview

AMAdam is a novel optimization algorithm designed to address the challenges of poor generalization and convergence rates in deep learning models. This repository contains the implementation of AMAdam and provides comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

## Key Features

- Improved optimization for deep learning models.
- Enhanced convergence rates.
- Robust generalization.
- Reduced hyperparameter dependency.
- Easy integration into your deep learning projects.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get started with using AMAdam in your projects. 

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch (select based on your preferred deep learning framework)

### Installation

You can install AMAdam via pip:

```bash
pip install amadam
```

### Usage

Here's how you can use AMAdam in your deep learning project:

```python
import amadam

# Define your deep learning model
model = ...

# Compile your model using AMAdam optimizer
optimizer = amadam.AMAdam(learning_rate=0.001)
model.compile(optimizer=optimizer, loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train your model
model.fit(...)
```
